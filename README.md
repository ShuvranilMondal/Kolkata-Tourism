-Welcome to the city of joy, Explore the beauty of the historical city.
-For years and years, even during the time of my first visit in 1962, it has been said that Calcutta was dying, that its port was silting up, its antiquated industry declining,    but Calcutta hadnâ€™t died. It hadnâ€™t done much, but it had gone on.
